# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how well the logisitic regression model could predict healthy loans from high-risk loans. 

Results:
* Accuracy .99
* Precision 1
* Recall 1

#Summary:
The accuracy score of the logistic regression model has a .99 acccuracy in predicting healthy and high-risk loans. It has a f1-score of 1 for predicting healthy loans and a f1-score of .88 for predicting high-risk loans. When the logistic resgression model was fit with oversampled it returned an f1-score of 1 for healthy loans and .93 for high-risk loans, and an overall accuracy of 1 showing that the model is good at predicting healthy and high-risk loans.
